# Machine-Learning-Classifiers
## Loan Distribution Classification Project: 
Predict loan approvals using Logistic Regression, SVM, and Gradient Boosting. This repo includes data exploration, model training, and evaluation metrics. Clone, install dependencies, and run the Jupyter notebooks or scripts to explore and compare these algorithms.
#### Project Overview
Objective: To classify loan applications into approved or denied categories based on various features.
Algorithms Implemented:
Logistic Regression: A fundamental classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane separating classes.
Gradient Boosting: An advanced ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners to improve predictive performance.
#### Features
Data Exploration: Analysis of loan distribution data to understand feature importance and data distribution.
Model Training: Implementation and comparison of Logistic Regression, SVM, and Gradient Boosting models.
Evaluation Metrics: Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
